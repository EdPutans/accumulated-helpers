# Type helpers

## What's this?
Helpers, typeguards, assistive functions I accumulated primarily for personal use and/or educational purposes.

### Some of the code was inspired by such talented individuals as: 

 [Charlie Jackson](www.github.com/cajacko)

 [Nicolas Marcora](www.github.com/minimumviableperson)

## Contributing
Contributing doesn't make sense as this is primarily accumulated code for personal use, by using it.
